dm_g_uninitialized_read.gz: This is interpreted as a ZIP file after which
reads from uninitialized memory happen (seemingly as part of an attempt to
treat it as a DMG file?). This is a lib7zip problem; it happens with
lib7zip's test_archive but not with p7zip's 7z or 7za. It's from
dependabot-core-0.50.9.tar.gz.
